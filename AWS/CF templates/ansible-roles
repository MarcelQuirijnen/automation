# roles are the next level of abstraction after playbooks.
# If a system (or group of hosts) need to play the role of webserver-with-apache, we can create
# a role 'apache-webserver'. Creating this role will result in the creation of a directory tree 
# with handlers, templates, tasks and variables. This tree contains everything necessary to fulfill
# the role of 'apache-webserver'.
# We can repeat this for all other 'system purposes'. When we run a playbook, we can simply refer 
# to the roles for that particular host. By well organizing the system roles, we reuse code effectively.

    mkdir roles && cd roles
    ansible-galaxy init apache2      # creates files, handlers, meta, templates, tasks and vars directories

Our playbook yaml file (webserver.yml) looks like
    ---
    - hosts: webservers
      roles:
        - role: apache2

and execute
    ansible-playbook webserver.yml
